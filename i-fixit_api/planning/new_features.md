## Integration Points

### API → Laravel Integration
1. **Opportunity Sync**: Django API provides opportunities, Laravel displays and manages them
2. **Market Data**: Django API provides market analysis, Laravel displays insights
3. **Price Predictions**: Django API provides predictions, Laravel shows recommendations
4. **Auction Alerts**: Django API monitors auctions, Laravel handles user notifications

### Laravel → API Integration
1. **Car Data**: Laravel provides historical car data for API analysis
2. **User Preferences**: Laravel manages preferences, API uses them for filtering
3. **Purchase Decisions**: Laravel tracks which opportunities were acted upon
4. **Performance Metrics**: Laravel provides ROI data for API learning algorithms
