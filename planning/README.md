# I-fixit Project Planning

## Overview
This folder contains the planning documentation for the I-fixit car investment tracking system. The system is designed to track cars through three phases: bidding/purchase, repair/parts, and dealership/sale, providing detailed cost tracking, profitability analysis, and business insights.

## Project Structure
The planning documentation is organized into the following files:

1. **business_rules.md**: Defines the business rules and requirements for the system
2. **project_plan.md**: Outlines the project phases, timeline, and deliverables
3. **database_design.md**: Details the database structure, tables, relationships, and indexes
4. **system_architecture.md**: Describes the overall system architecture and component interactions
5. **ui_design.md**: Provides mockups and design guidelines for the user interface
6. **api_design.md**: Specifies the API endpoints for future Python microservice integration
7. **user_stories.md**: Detailed user stories organized by user role
8. **technical_specifications.md**: Technical implementation details based on client requirements
9. **project_management.md**: Trello-style task tracking for development progress

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Laravel 11 (PHP 8.2+)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: Laravel Blade with Livewire, Bootstrap 5, Alpine.js, Font Awesome
- **Authentication**: Laravel Breeze/Jetstream with Two-Factor Authentication
- **Notifications**: WebSockets/Pusher for real-time notifications
- **Reporting**: Chart.js for data visualization, support for PDF, Excel, CSV exports
- **Hosting**: Shared hosting environment
- **Version Control**: GitHub with CI/CD pipeline
- **Future Integration**: Python microservice for web scraping and analysis

## Development Approach
The project will be developed in phases, starting with the core Laravel application for car investment tracking. The Python microservice for web scraping and opportunity identification will be developed as a future enhancement.

## Getting Started
1. Review the business rules to understand the system requirements
2. Examine the database design to understand the data structure
3. Study the system architecture to understand component interactions
4. Review the UI design to understand the user experience
5. Check the API design for future integration points
6. Follow the project plan for implementation timeline

## Next Steps
After reviewing the planning documentation, the next steps are:

1. Set up the Laravel 11 project
2. Configure the database
3. Implement the authentication system
4. Create the database migrations
5. Develop the core functionality
6. Build the user interface
7. Implement the API endpoints
8. Test the system
9. Deploy to production

## Future Enhancements
- Python microservice for web scraping auction sites
- Machine learning for price prediction and opportunity scoring
- Mobile application for on-the-go access
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with accounting systems
