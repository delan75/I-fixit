# I-fixit Business Rules

## Overview
I-fixit is a car investment tracking system designed to monitor the lifecycle of accident vehicles from purchase through repair to sale. The system tracks costs, calculates profitability, and provides business insights to support future purchasing decisions.

## Car Lifecycle Rules

### Phase 1: Bidding and Purchase
1. All cars must be registered in the system with complete details (make, model, year, VIN, etc.)
2. Purchase details must include auction source, purchase date, and purchase price
3. Initial condition assessment must be recorded including damage description and photos
4. Each car must be assigned a unique identifier in the system

### Phase 2: Repair and Parts
1. All replacement parts must be recorded with:
   - Part name and description
   - Cost
   - Supplier details (name, location, contact information)
   - Purchase date
2. Labor costs must be tracked separately from parts costs
3. Spray painting costs must be recorded (full body or partial)
4. All repair activities must be timestamped
5. The system must track the total repair cost for each vehicle
6. A car can only move to Phase 3 when marked as "repair completed"

### Phase 3: Dealership and Sale
1. Listing date at the dealership must be recorded
2. Asking price must be documented based on estimated market value
3. The system must track how long the car remains at the dealership
4. Actual selling price must be recorded (which may differ from estimated market value)
5. Sale date must be timestamped
6. A car is considered to have completed its investment cycle once marked as "sold"

8. The system must distinguish between estimated market value (for projections) and actual selling price (for final calculations)

## Financial Rules
1. Total investment is calculated as: Purchase Price + Transportation Costs + Parts Costs + Labor Costs + Painting Costs + Other Costs
2. Projected profit/loss is calculated as: Estimated Market Value - Total Investment (for cars not yet sold)
3. Actual profit/loss is calculated as: Actual Selling Price - Total Investment (for sold cars)
4. ROI is calculated as: (Profit/Loss รท Total Investment) ร 100
5. Each cost entry must be categorized appropriately (purchase, transportation, parts, labor, painting, other)
6. The system must maintain a running total of investment for each car
7. The system must provide both projected and actual financial metrics to guide purchasing decisions

## Reporting Rules
1. The system must provide profitability analysis for each completed car investment
2. Reports must be filterable by make, model, year, and profitability
3. The system must calculate average repair time, dealership time, and total investment cycle time

5. Users must be able to customize their analytics dashboard with relevant widgets
6. Analytics data must be exportable in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)
7. Historical performance tracking must be available for all completed car investments
8. Predictive models must be regularly updated with new data to maintain accuracy
9. Confidence scores must be displayed for all predictions to indicate reliability

## Supplier Marketplace Rules

2. Public listings must not reveal repair history or internal investment details
3. The public interface must include advanced search functionality similar to AutoTrader
4. Inquiries from potential buyers must be routed to the appropriate user
5. Public listings must include high-quality images and detailed specifications
6. SEO optimization must be applied to public listings for better visibility
7. View counts and engagement metrics must be tracked for each listing
