# I-fixit Project Management

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the I-fixit car investment tracking system using a Trello-style approach. Tasks are organized into columns based on their status, and each task includes details about priority, assignee, and completion status.

## How to Use This Document
1. Tasks are organized in columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done
2. Each task includes:
   - Task ID (for reference)
   - Description
   - Priority (High, Medium, Low)
   - Estimated effort (1-5, where 5 is highest)
   - Assignee
   - Completion status ([ ] or [x])
3. When a task is completed and approved, mark it with [x]
4. Move tasks between columns as they progress
5. Add new tasks to the Backlog as they are identified
